## 1. Introduction

Libretti is a core synthesizer library for integration with applications and games. It reads and writes its own binary file format for audio data, but it can also compile that data from text files that are written with [Libretti's scripting language](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/Documentation/Scripting%20Language%20Specification.txt)

This software is free, open source and [MIT Licenced](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/LICENSE). You can find the software repository [here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti).

### 1.1 Name Origin

**Libretti** is named after the plural form of the Italian word "Libretto" which means "booklet". A Libretto is used for musical performances where musical notes, lyrics and performance cues are recorded. This is the same objective that Libretti is intended to address within digital applications: it is meant to define data structures that house the musical content, runtime information and means of communicating playback.
