## 1. Introduction

Libretti is a core synthesizer library for integration with applications and games. It reads and writes its own binary file format for audio data, but it can also compile that data from text files that are written with [Libretti's scripting language](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/Documentation/Scripting%20Language%20Specification.txt)

This software is free, open source and [MIT Licenced](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/LICENSE). You can find the software repository [here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti).
